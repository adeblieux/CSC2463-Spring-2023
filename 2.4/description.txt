Paint App

Compose music to play along while painting. Using sequences, scheduling and looping.

Have interactions while painting generate corresponding sounds 
or music and make sure the gestures and sounds are related. 
e.g. brush stroke sounds or changing color sounds   
Sounds do not have to be realistic. 
Do they work together well with the music?

All user initiated events should have corresponding sound effects. 
What is the sound of clearing the screen? 
Changing colors? Actively painting? Saving a file?

Adapt the music and/or sound effects with the drawing states 
- emptyâ€¦ filled screen  e.g. as the drawing goes on, have the music, 
synthesis, sound files, or sound effects change and adapt 
to keep it interesting. (this may be the trickiest bit.)
